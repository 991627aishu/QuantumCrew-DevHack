#  Project Vrishabhavathi â€“ Smart Water Gradient Balancing

##  Problem Statement
Bengaluru struggles with **water imbalance**: heavy rainfall leads to urban flooding, while nearby districts like **Kolar and Chikkaballapur** suffer drought. Our project solves this by **capturing, monitoring, and redistributing water intelligently**, inspired by **the human circulatory system**.

---

##  Our Approach
- **Porous Asphalt Roads** â†’ Act like skin pores, letting rainwater seep into underground storage.
- **Pipes & Valves as Arteries & Veins** â†’ Lift irrigation mimics the heart pumping water to dry farmlands.
- **ESP32-based Prototype** â†’ Mimics city stormwater network, with pump, solenoid valves, and water-level sensors.
- **LDR + Laser Pairs** â†’ Measure water flow and detect backflow to prevent wastage.
- **Relay Automation** â†’ Controls pump & valves dynamically based on sensor readings.

---

##  Frontend (Dashboard)
- Built with **HTML + CSS + JavaScript**
- **Interactive Map (React-Leaflet)** showing:
  - Bengaluru lakes, storm drains
  - Water flow routes to dry agricultural lands
  - Pump stations (lift irrigation points)
- **Real-time Charts** displaying:
  - Water levels
  - Flow rate
  - Pump/valve status

---

##  Backend
- **Node.js + Express** (simple API for local data exchange)
- Receives sensor data from ESP32 via HTTP
- Runs basic AI logic for water redistribution decision-making (turn pump on/off, route water)

---

## Prototype
- 4-Channel Relay Board
- ESP32 Wi-Fi MCU
- Water Pump + 2 Solenoid Valves
- Water Level Sensor (PCB)
- 2 Laser + LDR Pairs for flow sensing
- Custom wiring with backflow prevention logic

---

## Future Scope
- AI-powered water demand prediction
- Integration with **Bengaluru Smart City data**
- Auto-controlled city valves & pumps
- Open API for citizen dashboards

##  Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16+ and npm
- Python 3.8+
- Git

### **One-Click Setup (Recommended)**

**Option 1: Python Script (Cross-platform)**
```bash
python setup_and_run.py
```

**Option 2: Windows Batch File**
```bash
start_system.bat
```

**Option 3: PowerShell Script (Windows)**
```powershell
.\start_system.ps1
```

### Manual Installation & Setup

1. **Clone and install dependencies:**
```bash
git clone <your-repo>
cd project-vrishabhavathi
npm install
cd frontend && npm install
cd ../backend && pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. **Start the system:**
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start backend
cd backend
python app.py

# Terminal 2: Start IoT simulator
cd iot-simulator
python simulator.py

# Terminal 3: Start frontend
cd frontend
npm start
```

3. **Access the dashboard:**
- Frontend: http://localhost:3000
- Backend API: http://localhost:5000
- WebSocket: ws://localhost:5000

## ðŸŽ¯ Demo Instructions

1. **One-Click Demo:**
```bash
python iot-simulator/simulator.py
```
This starts sending live mock sensor data every 5 seconds.

2. **Interactive Features:**
- Watch real-time sensor updates on the dashboard
- See animated flow lines on the Bengaluru map
- Monitor alerts when capacity exceeds 80%
- Control valves through the AI brain interface

##  Architecture

### Frontend (React + TailwindCSS)
- **Real-time Dashboard:** Live sensor data cards with neumorphic design
- **Interactive Map:** Bengaluru visualization with Leaflet showing sensors, lakes, and flow lines
- **Charts:** Rainfall vs storage trends using Chart.js
- **Alerts:** Overflow risk notifications with visual indicators

### Backend (Flask + WebSocket)
- **REST API:** Sensor data, forecasts, and control endpoints
- **WebSocket:** Real-time data streaming to frontend

### IoT Simulator (Python)
- **Mock Sensors:** Rain gauge, water level, flow sensors
- **Realistic Data:** Simulates actual Bengaluru weather patterns
- **REST Integration:** Sends data to backend every 5 seconds

##  Features

### Real-Time Monitoring
